### Description

In this game, you are trying to outfly a kamakazi pilot. His destiny is to fly as fast as he can directly at you. Your fate lies on your ability to trick/outmanuver the computer. The longer you go without him hitting you, the more points you will end up with at the end. 4 Plane designs to choose from. 7 Robust background images (borrowed from MS). Crafty (though sometimes a little anxious) "chaseAI". Each of the 7 levels increase in dificulty. SOUND (requires DirectX7) Each engine has a realistic prop sound. The sound portion could use a little tweaking. Each time the enemy plane hits you a jarring crash sound is triggered. All sounds were either found on the net or borrowed from MS. Oldschool plane graphic by me. E-Mail me with improvements davidkatrowski@juno.com
